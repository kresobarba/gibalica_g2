## INNOSID Erasmus+ Valencia Hackaton

Gibalica is a part of the INNOSID Erasmus+ Valencia Hackaton, and is intended to use the Google's state of the art machine learning library MediaPipe in conjunction with Unity to deliver an interactive light excercise assistant app, with pose detection, excercise tracking, repetition counting and minigames to stimulate health awareness in users and promote fitness and improve motor skills and coordination.

## Getting started
### This project requires Unity 2020.3.30f1 LTS

```
git clone https://github.com/kresobarba/gibalica_g2.git
```

In order to work with the project, you need to download the MediaPipe libraries that are built and distributed separately because of their large file size:

- Clone this repository and navigate to the GibalicaG2 subfolder
- Download .zip from this link [GibalicaG2Assets_Packages.zip]().
- Extract Assets and Packages from .zip into the GibalicaG2 folder, merge with existing Assets and Packages folders.
